FUNCTIONALITY
=====================================
Added: Localmaster.r
# script to run MTB from the command line
# .csv need to be in the exact format as described in Perera-bel et al.  
# use as follows: Rscript localmaster.r [csv file to be analyzed]
# IMPORTANT: The filename of the input file must have either "Fusion", "CNV" or "SNV" in it so that the script can correctly identify the type of input. 
# Added Documentation page that is shown when -h or --help is specified instead of a file

Added: input_maker.r
# very specific script to turn .xlsx files into .csv files compatible with the localmaster.r script
# works only for supplementary files (specifically, Supplementary Data 2,7,8,9) from:
# Ng, S.Y., Yoshida, N., Christie, A.L. et al. Targetable vulnerabilities in T- and NK-cell lymphomas identified through preclinical models. Nat Commun 9, 2024 (2018)
# doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04356-9
# link to publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04356-9
# Also processes "", which is a selection from publicatons on Patient data (WES data, RNA-Seq data & targeted sequencing data) for T Cell lymphoma. 
# can't be used for anything else, but might be worth a look to convert similar .xlsx files

==> More on functionality updates in GitLab!

Added: Docker environment
MTB is now implemented inside a docker image.
The application can be run after building the image (which will be included in GitLab) inside a docker container
