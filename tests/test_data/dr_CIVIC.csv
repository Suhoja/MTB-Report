HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.","18555254","PubMed",NA,"Santin et al., 2008, Int J Gynaecol Obstet","","4","accepted","1097","306",20,"17","37856333","37884915","","","ENST00000269571.5","",NA,NA,"","75","GRCh37","Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered.
