GDKD: Dienstmann et al., Cancer discovery 5.2 (2015), v20.0 
==================================================================
 
==> Dowloaded from https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2370773
==> Corresponding article: https://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/5/2/118.long
==> Some preprocessing done with script: "preprocess.R"
	==> Blank spaces "\s" were removed from gene names
	==> Special characters "^" and "_" were removed from columns containing PMID
	==> Variants in the same gene sharing annotations at disease, drug, evidence and association levels were aggregated into one single entry
==> Saved as GDKD.csv
   
   
CIViC: Griffith et al., Nat Genet (2017), release may differ
=====================================================================

==> Dowloaded from https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/releases
==> Corresponding article: https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3774
==> Some preprocessing done with script: "preprocess.R"
	==> Subselection of rows containing "Predictive" evidence (column "evidence_type")
	==> Variants in the same gene sharing annotations at disease, drug, evidence and association levels were aggregated into one single entry
==> Saved as CIViC.csv


TARGET: Van Allen et al., Nat Med (2014), v3  
==================================================================

==> downloaded from http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/target
==> Corresponding article: https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3559
==> Manually added 24 genes from Meric-Bernstam et al., J Natl Cancer Inst.(2015)
	==> Corresponding article: https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/107/7/djv098/913288
==> Saved as TARGET_MERIC.csv

OncoKB.csv: 
=================================================================

==> Downloaded "all actionable Variants" from http://oncokb.org/api/v1/utils/allActionableVariants.txt
==> Corresponding article: https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.17.00011
==> Preprocessing done with script "preprocess.R"
	==> Omitting rows that contain information we don't need
==> Saved as OncoKB.csv

cancer_types:
==================================================================
==> "in-house file" (from: https://github.com/jperera-bel/MTB-Report: README.md)


MTB_Databases_versions.csv: 
=================================================================
==> is produced by preprocess.R 
==> Contains information about the currently used database versions/releases in CIViC.csv, GDKD.csv and TARGET_MERIC.csv
00> Is copied as additional information whenever MTB Report is used in Batch-Mode (i.e. when localmaster.r is run)
