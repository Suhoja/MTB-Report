Variant
    Genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion events (indels), copy number alterations (CNV's), structural variants (SVs), and other events that differ from the "normal" genome.
Evidence statement
    A single idea presented in published literature connecting a variant to its clinical impact or interpretation.
Evidence type
    The predictive, prognostic or diagnostic association between an evidence statement and a variant.
Evidence level
    The experimental method from which the evidence statement is derived. Ranging from inferential associations from a single experiment to trusted associations that routinely inform clinical action.
Evidence direction
    The connecting element between an evidence type and an evidence statement. The direction of a statement is either supporting or refuting the clinical significance of an evidence type.
Clinical significance
    The sub-type of evidence type that the statement presents. For predictive evidence, a statement can support sensitivity or resistance. For prognositc evidence, a statement can support better or worse outcome. And for diagnostic evidence, a statement can support a diagnosis, or exclude it.
Evidence Level A
    Trusted association in clinical medicine that routinely informs treatment, including large scale metaanalyses, standard of care associations, and organizational recommendations.
Evidence Level B
    Clinical evidence from clinical trials and other primary tumor data.
Evidence Level C
    Case study evidence from individual case reports in peer reviewed journals.
Evidence Level D
    Preclinical evidence from cell line studies, mouse models, and other in vitro or in vivo models.
Evidence Level E
    Inferential association made from experimental data.
Preclinical
    Study using in vivo or in vitro models.
Predictive
    Evidence pertaining to a variant's effect on therapeutic response.
Diagnostic
    Evidence pertaining to a variant's impact on patient diagnosis (cancer subtype).
Prognostic
    Evidence pertaining to a variant's impact on disease progression, severity, or patient survival.
Predisposing
    Evidence pertaining to a variant's role in conferring susceptibility to a disease.
CIViC
    Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer
1-star
    Evidence likely does not belong in CIViC. Claim is not supported well by experimental evidence. Results are not reproducible, or have very small sample size. No follow-up is done to validate novel claims.
2-stars
    Evidence is not well supported by experimental data, and little follow-up data is available. Publication is from a journal with low academic impact. Experiments may lack proper controls, have small sample size, or are not statistically convincing.
3-stars
    Evidence is convincing, but not supported by a breadth of experiments. May be smaller scale projects, or novel results without many follow-up experiments. Discrepancies from expected results are explained and not concerning.
4-stars
    Strong, well supported evidence. Experiments are well controlled, and results are convincing. Any discrepancies from expected results are well-explained and not concerning.
5-stars
    Strong, well supported evidence from a lab or journal with respected academic standing. Experiments are well controlled, and results are clean and reproducible across multiple replicates. Evidence confirmed using separate methods.
Substitutes
    The drugs listed are often considered to be of the same family, or behave similarly in a treatment setting
Combination
    The drugs listed were used in as part of a combination therapy approach
Sequential
    The drugs listed were used at separate timepoints in the same treatment plan
Sensitivity
    Evidence that pertains to a response to a therapeutic agent. This includes complete remission, partial response, anti-tumorigenic activity, acheivement of stable disease, and others.
Resistance/Non-response
    Evidence that pertains to a lack of sensitivity to a therapeutic agent. This includes primary refractory disease, acquired resistance upon treatment, and other non-response observations.
