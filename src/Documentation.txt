#       GENERATION OF MOLECULAR TUMOR BOARD (MTB) REPORT       #
#--------------------------------------------------------------#
#   This script filters SNVs and CNVs using gene-drug public   #
#   databases. Then classifies the variants into levels of     #
#   evidence and finally presents the results in a report      #

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
This script is meant to be run from a specific docker environment containing a base R version and all dependencies.
The Dockerfile will call this script if a command line argument is given.
Run a docker container based on the image as follows:

$ docker run -v [Directory containing your data]:/work/files/ rdocker /work/files/[file with your data] [Cancer type] [SNV/CNV/Fusion]

The argument can either be:
- a .csv file to be analyzed by the MTB tool 
	-> IMPORTANT: The input files NEED to have "Fusion", "CNV" or "SNV" in them to correctly identify them.
	-> further information on the formatting requirements of this tool can be found here: https://github.com/jperera-bel/MTB-Report
- -h or --help to show this documentation
- [Cancer type] & [SNV/CNV/Fusion] are optional parameters.
- If [Cancer type] is not specified, it will be set to "unspecified".
- If [SNV/CNV/Fusion] is not specified, the script will try and grep these strings from the filename. If that is not successful, an error will occur.

Giving no arguments at all will start the Web App version (Shiny) of this tool with a Graphical User Interface.

The cancer types comply with the cancer types one can chose per drop down menu in iMTB (the shiny version).
